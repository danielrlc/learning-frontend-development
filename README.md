# Strategies for learning frontend development

There are now so many options for learning frontend development, it can be hard to know where to begin. I've been learning frontend development for a year now, and in this post I'm going to focus on:

- Learning tools
- How to learn quickly
- How to learn cheaply
- How to stay motivated

As I'm sure you know without my telling you, it's important to be an active learner. Simply reading a textbook on JavaScript from cover to cover won't get you very far with the language. You need to be learning, testing yourself, and experimenting. You also need to keep all your learning organised.

Let's start with some learning tools. I recommend using a wide variety of learning resources, but this makes staying organised a challenge. When you're studying on a course, a lot of the organising has been done for you. You have a course curriculum, assignments and deadlines. But if you're studying on your own, you have to forge your own path.

I've been using [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com) to keep myself organised. It's very simple to use, syncs up across devices, and you can search for and find anything you put on there very quickly. I recommend you use Workflowy as your central learning hub, and link to all your learning resources from there.

Now you need a tool to test yourself while learning. For this, I recommend [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com).
